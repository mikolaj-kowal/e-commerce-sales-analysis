-- Aims of the update statements:
-- Ensure date values in specific columns follow these rules:
--
-- 'Orders.order_date'        -> random values between '2024-09-01' and '2025-08-31'
-- 'Orders.updated_at'        -> random values between 'Orders.order_date' + 2 days
-- 'Customers.signup_date'    -> earlier than the first order date for each customer
-- 'Products.created_at'      -> earlier than the first 'Orders.order_date' for each product
-- 'Products.updated_at'      -> random dates between 'Products.created_at' and 15 days later
-- 'Payments.payment_date'    -> random dates between 'Orders.order_date' and 2 days later
-- 'Shipping.ship_date'       -> random dates after the later of 'Orders.updated_at' 
--                               or 'Payments.payment_date' + 1 day
-- 'Shipping.delivery_date'   -> random dates between 'Shipping.ship_date' and 6 days later
-- 'Reviews.review_date'	  -> random dates after related 'Orders.order_date' of the product by customer and today
